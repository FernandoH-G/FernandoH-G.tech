    "meet_me": "I was born in Fresno, CA. My folks moved a lot to follow their seasonal work. The constant moving at a young age taught me to make friends fast and to be ever ready for big moves. These valuable lessons helped me manage grade school up to junior high. Eventually we settled in Bakersfield, CA, where I attended middle school and graduated from Bakersfield High School.  Going into college, I had it as my goal to eventually become a lawyer. In order to fulfill this goal, I studied and eventually graduated with a degree in Philosophy from California State University, Bakersfield. My Philosophy studies is an integral part of my character and it made me the person I am today. I met good classmates and even better professors. One classmate turned me on to a UCLA Law Fellows program where I applied to and eventually was a part of and a professor helped me land an internship in a law firm in Bakersfield. Attending this internship was a pivotal part of my life. After some time with the internship, I started to have doubts as to my motivation to become a lawyer. After much introspection, I decided to no longer pursue a career in Law. Cut to 2016, I saw myself attending CSUB once more, but this time, as a computer science student! I knew that after my first year, programming was what I wanted to devote my life to."
